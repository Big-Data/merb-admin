# ==== Standalone MerbAdmin configuration
# 
# This configuration/environment file is only loaded by bin/slice, which can be 
# used during development of the slice. It has no effect on this slice being
# loaded in a host application. To run your slice in standalone mode, just
# run 'slice' from its directory. The 'slice' command is very similar to
# the 'merb' command, and takes all the same options, including -i to drop 
# into an irb session for example.
#
# The usual Merb configuration directives and init.rb setup methods apply,
# including use_orm and before_app_loads/after_app_loads.
#
# If you need need different configurations for different environments you can 
# even create the specific environment file in config/environments/ just like
# in a regular Merb application. 
#
# In fact, a slice is no different from a normal # Merb application - it only
# differs by the fact that seamlessly integrates into a so called 'host'
# application, which in turn can override or finetune the slice implementation
# code and views.
#

use_orm :datamapper
use_test :rspec
use_template_engine :erb

Merb::Config.use do |c|

  # When running a slice standalone, you're usually developing it,
  # so enable template reloading by default.
  c[:reload_templates] = true
